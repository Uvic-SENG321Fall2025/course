## 9.0 Reflection on the use of AI
In this section, reflect on the differences between AI-generated content and the content you generate on your own. **Please write your RFPs yourselves and then use AI afterwards for a comparison.** Here are the questions we would like you to answer in this section: 

- List all the ways that your team used generative AI in this deliverable. Please be specific. (E.g. to identify key stakeholders). 


- Which AI model(s) did you use? (E.g. ChatGPT 4o)

  Following are the hints on how you choose your final version, what we need to see is what human generated version and what genAi gave you and which one you chosen and why you chosen it, reflect on that.

(- What similarities and differences did you notice between your content and the content generated by AI? Please give examples from your RFP. 

- What aspects of the AI-generated artifact surprised you or that you hadn't considered? Provide examples from your RFP. 

- What are some areas where AI did not help you in writing your RFP? Be specific about those areas. 

- What did you do when AI’s content differed from your own content? How did you decide what content to keep? Give examples of the differences here. 

- How confident were you in generative AI’s output? 

- In your observations, what made prompts  effective and what made prompts ineffective? How did you decide that a prompt was effective, or not? Please give examples of your prompts for both good and bad prompts, and your perceived good and bad responses from the AI model. 

- If you had to repeatedly prompt the AI model, why did you keep updating your prompt? What changes were you making to your prompts? How did you know when you were satisfied with the output? Give examples of conversations requiring repeated or changing prompts. 

- Did you perceive that the AI model gained and maintained contextual understanding during the conversation? E.g. did you keep having to remind the model of something introduced early on? What context did it remember and what context did it forget?)



## 10.0 Glossary of terms
Project jargon, or jargon from client organization should be included here so that this document is readable

## RFP Overview
Your first task as Clients, is to brainstorm a project idea for a solution you will want to see designed and prototyped by another (Developer) Team in the course. As described in the Project specification, this involves your team brainstorming a project idea that elaborates a problem to be solved, and a set of requirements for a technological solution. This year we will explore problem spaces that can benefit from AI-based solutions. We will provide a scope for the problem domain in the first class of the term. As Clients, you also need to come up with a "Client Organization" for which you pretend your team represents. The Client organization will own the problem you present to the Developer Team. 

Here are some guidelines when selecting an organization and problem: 

- The organization demostrates a situation which has a **clear need for improvement**
- The organization and its problem involve a **number of diverse categories of end-users** that are impacted
- The system uses a GUI (Graphical User Interface)
- The solution you envision benefits from the use of AI

Note: you will not be implementing the solution; it will be another student group, the Developer group, that will design the solution. In the process, their designs and solution might be different from what you envision, and that is ok. 

Once you define the Client problem and Organization, you will be interviewed by the Developer Team, and involved in providing feedback throughout an iterative design process throughout the term. Your first deliverable is the request for proposal (RFP).
Remember the **RFP is due on Sunday, on Week 2 at 11pm!**

Included here are the **RFP template** and **a few examples**. 

The RFP for the **Cowichan Valley Residential Care Project** is an "authentic" RFP document from industry practice and it illustrates example description text for each section in the teamplate. It is way too long for any course project, nonetheless a good example to learn about the contents of each section. 

The RFP for the **Student project** is from a previous SENG321 course and one that was of acceptable quality. Its length is what we would expect in this course. Note that we blocked the actual student names.

# Example Requirements Document

Below is link to a completed requirements document from last year. Please keep in mind that this is a completed document; your document will only look something like this at the end of this course. Furthermore, there were no submissions last year that received 100%. Do not copy exactly what is in the example. Just because you do something the way it was done in the example, does not necessarily mean that you will score well.
